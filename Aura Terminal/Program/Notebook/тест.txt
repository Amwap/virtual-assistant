[Verse 1]
(Alright I'm done, ah)
I love what I can’t see
What’s expected of you, what's expected of me?
Now it’s quarter to three
Let it all get away

[Refrain]
Oh, what the hell can I do?
To fill the pages (to fill the pages)
Meet the strangers (meet the strangers)
Kiss the girl, take it in, feel the ages (kiss the girl, take it in, feel the ages)
A time or two
But it's all so good
To let up

[Chorus]
Dead weight (dead weight)
Dead weight, dead weight (dead weight)
Dead weight, dead weight (dead weight)
Dead weight, dead weight (dead weight)
Dead weight

[Verse 2]
Got everything I need (haha, yeah)
Clothes on my back
The wind on my teeth (oo)
What I control is in me
There’s more wood to burn

[Refrain]
Oh, what the hell can I do? (can I do)
To fill the pages (to fill the pages)
Meet the strangers (meet the strangers)
Kiss the girl, take it in, feel the ages (kiss the girl, take it in, feel the ages)
A ride or two
But I fall so good
When I go, woo

[Chorus]
Dead Weight (Dead Weight)
Dead Weight, dead weight (dead weight)
Dead weight, dead weight (dead weight)
Dead weight, dead weight (dead weight)
Dead weight, dead weight (dead weight)

[Outro]
Dead weight, dead weight (dead weight)
Dead weight
